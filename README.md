#Machine Learning -Premier-League-Match-Predictor-Model
This model leverages historical football match data to predict future match outcomes. Implemented using Python, it employs data science libraries to preprocess the data, including date and time conversion and categorical encoding for variables such as venue and opponent. The model also calculates rolling averages of match statistics to provide contextual insights. Utilizing a RandomForestClassifier, the model is trained on this enriched data to predict match results. Its performance is measured using accuracy and precision scores, and feature importance is visualized to highlight key predictive factors. The results, showcasing predicted versus actual outcomes, are presented in a detailed table and visualizations, offering a comprehensive view of the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.





# Tech
Python: The core programming language used for the entire project.
